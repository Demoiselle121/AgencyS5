There is two interfaces here, each should be runned separately. One for user interface (pacific-main). And the other for the admin(Skydash). U can runn the user interface by running index.jsp. U can runn the admin interface by running index.jsp. For security, i removed my login data for linking between the server and database. U can replace it with your login data.
Everything is ofc linked with my own database (Workbench - MySQL)
